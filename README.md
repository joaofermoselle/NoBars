# NoBars

*NoBars* is a small utility that allows you to quickly hide the menu and the dock bars on your desktop just by clicking on a menu icon. 

It requires OS X El Capitan.

## Why do I need this?

Hiding the Dock requires you to ctrl-click on the Dock and select the "hide" option. Hiding the menu bar needs you to go the System Preferences. And then your icons will appear misplaced. Then you might not like the new look and you have to undo everything. Yuck!

With this utility, a single click will handle everything for you!

## Installation

Still under development... This will be updated when the first release is out!
