# NoBars

*Being behind bars may prevent you from enjoying all the sweet free space...*

**NoBars** is a small utility that allows you to quickly hide the menu and the dock bars on your desktop just by clicking on a menu icon. 

It requires OS X El Capitan.

## Why do I need this?

Hiding the Dock requires you to ctrl-click on the Dock and select the "hide" option. Hiding the menu bar needs you to go the System Preferences. And then your icons will appear misplaced. Then you might not like the new look and you have to undo everything. Yuck!

With this utility, a single click will handle everything for you!

## Installation

1. [Download the latest release.](https://github.com/joaofermoselle/NoBars/releases)
2. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility. Click the lock icon and unlock using your password. Drag NoBars.app you just downloaded to the list of apps. Lock again.

## Is this safe?

This app was not written with the intent of harming any Mac and it is safe to the best of my knowledge. I include known bugs in the release descriptions. However, there may be unknown bugs and I cannot guarantee anything in that case, so you are advised to **use the app at your own risk!**
